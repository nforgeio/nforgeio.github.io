          This section describes the primary Temporal workflow concepts and terminology.  You should take the
          time to skim over these terms to give you come context as you dive further in.
        </p><div class="tableSection"><table><tr><td><p><strong>Activity</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Workflow implementations are typically organized into <strong>workflows</strong> that
                make decisions determining what's do be done and <strong>activities</strong> that actually
                perform the work.  For example, workflows may decide to read/write something to a database or
                call an external service and then then workflow will call an activity to actually perform
                the operation.
              </p><p>
                You can think of a workflow as the decider and activities as the primary way for
                workflows to interact with the outside world, which a workflow should never do
                directly.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Child Workflow</strong></p></td><td><p>
                These are workflows that were started in the context of another workflow.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Client Stub</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Stubs provide a way define workflows and activities using an
                <span class="code">interface</span> such that you'll be able to
                start and interact with workflows and activities using strongly
                typed methods that will be verified by the .NET compiler when
                building your code.
              </p><p>
                This capability was pioneered by Temporal with their Java API and we
                were strongly encouraged to go this route for .NET (which was an
                easy decision since it's obviously better).  The Go Temporal client
                does not implement stubs.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>External Workflow</strong></p></td><td><p>
                These are top-level workflows that were not started as a child workflow. 
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Event History</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Temporal tracks workflow and activity executions such that the
                past decisions and workflow state is durably persisted to the
                cluster database.  This is the secret that allows developers
                to author workflows as basic code when under the covers, the
                workflow is essentially a state machine.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Namespace</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Temporal is is a multi tenant service. The unit of isolation is called a namespace. 
                Each namespace acts as a namespace for task queue names as well as workflow Ids.
                For example, when a workflow is started, it is started in a specific namespace. 
                Temporal guarantees a unique workflow Id within a namespace, and supports running
                workflow executions to use the same workflow Id if they are in different namespaces.
              </p><p>
                Various configuration options like retention period or archival destination are
                configured per namespace as well through a special CRUD API or through the Temporal CLI.
                In the multi-cluster deployment, namespace is a unit of fail-over. 
                Each namespace can only be active on a single Temporal cluster at a time. 
                However, different namespaces can be active in different clusters and can fail-over
                independently.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Query</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Started workflows can be queried synchronously by client applications
                to retrieve information about the current state of the workflow.  This
                is a read-only operation and a query must never modify workflow state.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Run ID</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Temporal assigns a UUID to each execution of a workflow so they can
                be uniquely identified.  This differs from the workflow ID which
                is essentially the name of the workflow.  For example, you could
                start a workflow managing a user's junk email folder with a
                workflow ID like <strong>jeff@lilltek.com-JUNK</strong>.
                Then you could manage, query, or signal the workflow using this
                stable name.  Temporal will assign a UUID as the run ID and if
                the workflow restarts itself, the new run will retain the same
                workflow ID, but will be assigned a new run ID.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Signal</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Signals provides a convienent way to inform a workflow that something
                external happened.  Signals may include arbitrary parameters but
                signals don't return a result.  Signals are delivered asynchronously,
                meaning the caller may see the signal method return before the
                workflow actually received the signal.
              </p><p>
                Workflow signal methods will typically use a <a href="T_Neon_Temporal_WorkflowQueue_1.htm">WorkflowQueue<span id="LSTDFB2F591_0"></span><script type="text/javascript">AddLanguageSpecificTextSet("LSTDFB2F591_0?cs=&lt;|vb=(Of |cpp=&lt;|nu=(|fs=&lt;'");</script>T<span id="LSTDFB2F591_1"></span><script type="text/javascript">AddLanguageSpecificTextSet("LSTDFB2F591_1?cs=&gt;|vb=)|cpp=&gt;|nu=)|fs=&gt;");</script></a>
                to interact with the workflow decision logic.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>TaskQueue</strong></p></td><td><p>
                The workflow and activities you develop will need to be hosted in a
                workflow service that you'll write.  This can be a simple as a Console
                application that registers the workflows and activities it implements
                with the Temporal cluster.  You'll need to specify the namespace where the
                workflows and activities will be hosted by Temporal and also a
                <strong>task queue</strong> string.
              </p><p>
                Temporal uses the task queue you specify to identify all instances of
                a workflow service running such that work can be distributed to across
                these services.
              </p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img src="icons/AlertCaution.png" alt="Important note" /> Important</th></tr><tr><td><p>
                  All instances of your workflow should implement <strong>exact same workflows and activities</strong>
                  because Temporal doesn't track exactly which workflows and activities are exposed
                  by each workflow service instance.  Temporal assumes that all worker instances
                  registered with same task queue can execute any of the registered workflows
                  and activities.
                </p><p>
                  For example, say you have workflow-A and workflow-B running on server-0 and then workflow-B
                  and workflow-C running on server-1, and both of these registered with task lisk MYTASKS.
                  Then you execute workflow A.  Temporal may attempt execute it on server-1 but this will
                  fail, because workflow-A isn't implemented there.  Temporal is smart and will retry by
                  selecting another worker registered for MYTASKS until it finds a worker that can handle
                  it (or the workflow times out).
                </p><p>
                  So Temporal will typically recover and execte the workflow or activity but recognize that
                  there may be some delay.  You should also keep this in the back of your mind when you're
                  thinking about how workflow services should be upgraded (e.g. all at once, rolling update,...)
                </p></td></tr></table></div></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Task Token</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Temporal supports external activity completion.  This is a less convienent
                an alternative to signalling.  You can take advantage of this by starting
                an activity that instead of completing the operation itself, obtains a
                task token from Temporal and then signals Temporal that the activity will
                be completed externally.
              </p><p>
                Before the activity returns, it will need to put the token somewhere
                (like a database) and then you'll have an external service waiting for
                something to happen that indicates that activity can be completed and
                then use the task token to complete the activity, specifying the return
                value if necessary.
              </p><div class="alert"><table><tr><th><img src="icons/AlertNote.png" alt="Tip" /> Tip</th></tr><tr><td><p>
                  External activity completion implementions are generally more difficulit to
                  code because you need to worry about saving the token somewhere and you also
                  need to code an external service that may need to do activity heartbeating.
                </p><p>
                  We recommend that you use signals for most situations.
                </p></td></tr></table></div></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Worker/Service</strong></p></td><td><p>
                This is an application or service that implements one or more workflows
                and/or activities.  When a worker or worker service starts, it will
                register its workflows and activities with Cadence.  Then Temporal
                will assign workflows and activities to each worker service as it
                sees fit.
              </p><p>
                Your workflow and activity code will be executed as required with
                Temporal recording state as the workflow progresses as well as the
                results returned by the activities and workflow.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Workflow</strong></p></td><td><p>
                Essentially, a workflow is a method that runs some logic and optionally returns
                a result.  The method is written in C# or some other compatible .NET language.
                Workflows always interact with the external world via activities.  Workflows
                use activities to query external state so that can impact decisions made
                by the workflow and workflows also use activities to impact the outside world
                by writting to a database, sending an email, etc.
              </p><p>
                Workflows can be configured to run for very long times.  Years and perhaps even
                centuries.  Temporal ensures that the state of an executing workflow will be
                durably persisted such that the workflow can be reassigned to a different worker
                in response to server failures, load-balancing, etc.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Workflow Execution</strong></p></td><td><p>
                A <a href="T_Neon_Temporal_WorkflowExecution.htm">WorkflowExecution</a>
                is used to identify an instance of a workflow.  This included the workflow and
                run IDs and may reference a workflow that's still in progress or a completed workflow.
              </p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Workflow ID</strong></p></td><td><p>
                A workflow ID is essentially the name of the workflow.  This is an arbitrary
                string.  It's often handy to set this to some kind of business identifier like
                the name of the entity the workflow is handling.
