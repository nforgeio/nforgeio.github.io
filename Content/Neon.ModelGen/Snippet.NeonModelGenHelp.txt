neon-modelgen
-------------
Generates C# source code for data and service models defined as interfaces
within a compiled assembly.

USAGE:

    neon-modelgen [OPTIONS] ASSEMBLY-PATH [OUTPUT-PATH]

ARGUMENTS:

    ASSEMBLY-PATH       - Path to the assembly being scanned.

    OUTPUT-PATH         - Optional path to the output file, otherwise
                          the generated code will be written to STDOUT.

OPTIONS:

    --source-namespace=VALUE    - Specifies the namespace to be used when
                                  scanning for models.  By default, all
                                  classes within the assembly wll be scanned.

    --target-namespace=VALUE    - Specifies the namespace to be used when
                                  generating the models.  This overrides 
                                  the original type namespaces as scanned
                                  from the source assembly.

    --persisted                 - Generate database persistence related code.

                                  NOTE: This only supports Couchbase

    --ux=xaml                   - Generate additional code for the specified
                                  UX framework.  Currently, only [xaml] is
                                  supported

    --no-services               - Don't generate any service clients.

    --targets=LIST              - Specifies the comma separated list of target 
                                  names.  Any input models that are not tagged
                                  with one of these names will not be generated.

    --debug-allow-stepinto      - Indicates that generated class methods will
                                  not include the [DebuggerStepThrough]
                                  attribute allowing the debugger to step
                                  into the generated methods.

    --v1compatible              - Generates models using the v1.x compatible
                                  ""__T"" property name rather than ""T$$""
                                  which is generated by ModelGen v2+.

    --log=PATH                  - Optionally outputs any errors to the specified 
                                  log file and supresses potentially spurious
                                  from the standard output and exit code.

REMARKS:

This command is used to generate enhanced JSON based data models and
REST API clients suitable for applications based on flexible noSQL
style design conventions.  See this GitHub issue for more information:
