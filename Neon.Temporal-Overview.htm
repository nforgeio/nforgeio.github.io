          Temporal is a wonderful open source solution for developers who need to deploy reliable workflows
          for small to highly scaled applications and services.  This isn't the first workflow product, but
          it may be the first one tailored specifically for developers who want to code workflows in a popular
          language as opposed to drawing flow-charts, editing crazy XML workflow definitions, and/or jumping
          through multi-step build hoops.
        </p><p><strong>Neon.Temporal</strong> combined with Temporal Server lets you implement workflows in
          any supported .NET language with little friction.  You can even set breakpoints and debug your
          workflows directly in Visual Studio.
        </p><p>
          This page describes the key concepts.  Subsequent pages will show you how to get started. 
        </p></div><div class="collapsibleAreaRegion" id="overview"><span class="collapsibleRegionTitle" onclick="SectionExpandCollapse('ID1RB')" onkeypress="SectionExpandCollapse_CheckKey('ID1RB', event)" tabindex="0"><img id="ID1RBToggle" class="collapseToggle" src="icons/SectionExpanded.png" />Overview</span></div><div id="ID1RBSection" class="collapsibleSection"><p>
          Temporal is a general purpose platform that can handle workflows that exist for just a moment or two
          or workflows that run for days months or even years.  Temporal persists the state of running workflows
          using the Cassandra or MySQL database to ensure that workflows will execute correctly even in the
          face of hardware failures.  Temporal and Cassandra can be easily scaled horizontally for fault
          tolerance and to handle very high loads.  Uber has Temporal deployments that can handle millions
          of simultaneous workflows.
        </p><p>
          Here's a video by <strong>Maxim Fateev</strong>, the creator of Temporal, describing what
          Temporal is and how it works:
        </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llmsBGKOuWI" target="_blank">Temporal: The Only Workflow Platform You'll Ever Need</a></p><p>
          and here's a link to the Neon Temporal client namespace documentation if you want
          to dive in immediately:
        </p><p><a href="N_Neon_Temporal.htm">Neon.Temporal</a></p><p>
          To supplement Maxim's video, we'll discuss how this works at a high-level below so you'll have
          some understanding of the key concepts and how they fit together:
        </p><dl><dt>Temporal Server</dt><dd><p>
              Responsible for coordinating and tracking workflows and activities.  From the perspective of
              a workflow developer, this includes the Temporal Server itself as well as the database where
              Temporal perisits its state.  Temporal supports Cassandra for data storage as well as MySQL,
              Postgres, as well as a plugin architecture for custom database integrations.  Cassandra is
              free, scalable, and battle tested and is what we've been using for the Neon related projects.
            </p><p>
              When we use the term Temporal Server this typically includes the 
              associated database as well.  Production deployments may include multiple Temporal Servers
              for reliability and scalability.  This may be referred to as a <strong>Temporal Cluster</strong>
              or perhaps as the <strong>Temporal Server</strong> since the cluster-ness is mostly abstracted
              from a workflow author's perspective.
            </p></dd><dt>Temporal Client</dt><dd><p>
              Provides the APIs for accessing a Temporal Server or Cluster.  This is implemented by
              <a href="T_Neon_Temporal_TemporalClient.htm">TemporalClient</a>
              and you'll establish a connection to a Temporalr server by calling
              <a href="M_Neon_Temporal_TemporalClient_ConnectAsync.htm">ConnectAsync</a>,
              passing settings that specify the IP address or host name for one or more of the
              Temporal servers in the cluster.
            </p><p>
              Once you have a connection, you can use it to deploy, call, as well as manage workflows
              and activities.
            </p></dd><dt>Workflows</dt><dd><p>
              A fault-oblivious stateful function that orchestrates activities. A Workflow has full control over 
              which activities are executed, and in which order. A Workflow must not affect the external world 
              directly, only through activities. What makes workflow code a Workflow is that its state is preserved
              by Temporal. Therefore any failure of a worker process that hosts the workflow code does not affect
              the workflow execution. The Workflow continues as if these failures did not happen. 
              At the same time, activities can fail any moment for any reason. Because workflow code is fully
              fault-oblivious, it is guaranteed to get notifications about activity failures or timeouts and
              act accordingly. There is no limit on potential workflow duration.
            </p></dd><dt>Activities</dt><dd><p>
              A business-level function that implements your application logic such as calling a service or transcoding
              a media file. An activity usually implements a single well-defined action; it can be short or long running. 
              An activity can be implemented as a synchronous method or fully asynchronously involving multiple processes.
              An activity can be retried indefinitely according to the provided exponential retry policy. If for any reason
              an activity is not completed within the specified timeout, an error is reported to the workflow and the workflow 
              decides how to handle it. There is no limit on potential activity duration.
            </p></dd><dt>Local Activities</dt><dd><p>
              An activity that is invoked directly in the same process by a workflow code. It consumes much less resources
              than a normal activity, but imposes a lot of limitations like low duration and lack of rate limiting.  These
              are commonly used for things like making a REST call or performing a database operation.
            </p></dd><dt>Workers</dt><dd><p>
              Workers are responsible for actually implementing workflows and activities.  This is code that a workflow
              developer will write and deploy.  You'll need to establish a connection a Temporal cluster anmd then
              register your workflow and activity implementations with the cluster.  Then, Temporal will schedule
              workflows and activities on these workers by instantiating and invoking your workflow and activity
              classes.
            </p></dd><dt>Decisions and History</dt><dd><p>
              A decision is any action taken by a workflow implementation.  This may include calling an activity or
              child workflow as well as other built-in operations like sleeping for a period of time or generating a
              UUID or random number.  Typically, the workflow code consists of just the logic around coordinating
              activities and child workflows that actually perform the workflow operations.
            </p><p>
              In legacy workflow platforms, a decision task would be modeled as conditional nodes in a flow chart along
              with nodes that do something like call a REST API, do a database operation, send an email, etc.  Temporal
              is code centric, so a decision task is more of a virtual concept.  It's essentially the bit of logic
              in your workflows between activity calls as well as the built-in APIs.
            </p><p>
              Temporal maintains a durable history of the results of all activities and built-in APIs so that 
              any workflow can be rescheduled on a different worker instance and end up in the same state as
              it had before.  This is central to how Temporal works.
            </p><p>
              Note that workflow logic must never access or modify global or external state directly.  This includes
              things like performing database or REST operations but also includes things like getting the time,
              generating UUIDs and random numbers, or sleeping for a period of time.  You must use activities,
              child workflows or the built-in APIs to ensure that the workflow will end up in the same state after
              being rescheduled.  Workflow logic has a limited amount of time to make decisions between activity,
              child workflow, or built-in API calls.  By default, a workflow has 10 seconds to decide what to do
              next.  This can be increased to a maximum of 60 seconds via configuration.
            </p></dd><dt>Namespaces and Task Lists</dt><dd><p>
              Temporal is a multi-tenant service and uses namespaces to isolate each tenant from any others.  A namespace
              is simply a unique namespace where workflows and activities as well as their worker implementations
              are registered.
            </p></dd><dt>Workflow and Run IDs</dt><dd><p>
              Workflows are identifyed by Workflow ID.  This can be the name of a business entity like
              <strong>order-00001234</strong> that identifies a product order in a database or
              <strong>ltv-jeff@lilltek.com</strong> that identifies a workflow that periodically
              computes the life-time-value (LTV) of the user with ID <strong>jeff@lilltek.com</strong>.
              Workflow IDs can be any string including a UUID.
            </p><p>
              Workflow Run IDs are UUIDs generated by Temporal for each run of a workflow.  Workflows
              are allowed (via configuration) to be able to scheduled multiple times using the same
              Workflow ID.  This is handy when workflow IDs map to business entities.  In this case,
              you can use the Run ID to identify exactly which run of the workflow you're interested in.
              The most workflow recent run is assumed when you don't specify a Run ID.
            </p></dd></dl><div class="mediaNear"><div class="caption" /><img alt="overview-components" src="media/overview-components.png" /></div><p>
          The diagram above depicts how these components fit together.  The two <strong>RED</strong>
          boxes show the Temporal Cluster (one or more Temporal server instances) along with its backing database.
          You'll need to deploy and configure these as outlined here:
          <a href="https://github.com/uber/Temporal/tree/master/docker" target="_blank">Temporal Deployment</a></p><p>
          You'll be responsible for implementing and deploying the <strong>GREEN</strong>
          boxes including one or more workers with your workflow and activity implementations as
          well as any applications that need to run or monitor workflows.  We'll do a very high
          level workflow of how this works:
        </p><ol><li><p>
              Deploy and start the Temporal cluster along with its database.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Author your workflows and activities as a deployable process.  This is typically just a
              .NET Console application that runs on its own or perhaps as a Docker image in a Kubernetes
              cluster.  These workers will register their workflow and activity implementations with Temporal
              under a task list (<strong>Acme-PROD</strong> in this case) to isolate these registrations
              from other cluster users.
            </p><p>
              For this example, we each worker registers a workflow that is designed to send an email
              and the underlying activity that actually sends the email.  The workflow essentially consists
              of a single decision task that just calls the activity or perhaps something including more complex
              that customizes retry handling.
            </p></li><li><p>
            Once one or more workers have registered their workflow/activity implementations and started,
            the Temporal cluster will be ready to schedule workflow and activity executions on them.
            </p></li><li><p>
            The last <strong>GREEN</strong> box represents your application code.  This can
            be anything such as a website, REST API backend, console application, etc.  This is
            typically where workflows will be invoked.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Let's say the application needs to send an email.  The application will need to connect
              to the Temporal cluster with the <strong>Acme-PROD</strong> task list and invoke
              the <strong>Send()</strong> workflow, passing the target address, subject, message,
              and such.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Temporal receives the workflow call and persists it to the database.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Temporal then looks for any workers that have registered the workflow implementation.
              It chooses one and invokes the workflow there.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Workflows are registered on workers as interfaces and classes.  From the workflow developer's
              perspective, a workflow invocation means that an instance of your workflow class will be
              constructed and your workflow entry point method will be called.
            </p></li><li><p>
              For this example, the <strong>Send()</strong> workflow simply calls the <strong>Send()</strong>
              activity to actually send the email.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Temporal receives the <strong>Send()</strong> activity call, persists it to the database
              and then looks for any workers that have registered the activity, chooses one and invokes the
              activity there.  Activity implementations work essentially the same as workflows: an activity
              class will be instantiated and its entry point method will be called.
            </p></li><li><p>
              The activity sends the message and returns any results to Temporal.  Temporal server persists
              the result into the workflow history and then returns the reslt to the workflow.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Temporal server returns the activity result to the workflow when then returns its result
              back to Temporal which records it to the database and then returns the result back to
              the original calling application.
